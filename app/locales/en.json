This will help them to build organizational systems (working environment, processes, procedures, ...) that are far more error tolerant. Not the occurrence of mistakes, but the limitation of the consequences is what matters.",

Willing to fully understand the workers' context and finding out how normal work happens, will result in identifying ways to improve the work processes.",
        "p4": "If you see workers as solutions rather than problems, and by focusing on helping workers overcome problems and be successful, you build trust. The end result is a strong communication channel within the organization and the ability to come up with innovative ideas to solve problems. In other circumstances, they would never have come up with such solutions that can be carried out as much as possible by the team."

        "p4": "In our approach to understand the story behind noncompliance, we look at the full context. There are multiple reasons why at that moment something triggered a noncompliance. By listening to the people doing the work and involving them in finding solutions that are preferably in their sphere of control, we get their buy-in.

        "p4": "In our atypical approach, we don't look for the root cause. As failure is never a linear sequence of events, so there is almost never a root cause. Instead of linearly deconstructing the incident, we construct the incident context. We won't look at the individual pieces of the incident, but at the relationship between those pieces.",
        "p5": "In many incident investigations, simply describing what the conditions are in which normal work happens is sufficient to explain how the incident happened. We will not only find issues that contributed to the incident with this approach, we will also identify other areas where improvements can be made, so the incident investigation becomes reactive and proactive at the same time.",
